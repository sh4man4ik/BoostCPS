# BoostCPS
A simple C++ console program that boosts CPS. It is based on WinAPI.

# Quick start
The source exe file with the program can be downloaded in the *Release* section.

# How it works?
To run the program you need to run the *exe* file accordingly. After that by pressing the key on **N**, the CPS boost will start. This will also be signaled by a sound sign. To stop the boost, you should press **M**, and then a characteristic sound will also be played, after which a fast and smooth decline will start (~3 seconds). As soon as the decline is over, the same sound will be played, which will indicate the end and we can use it again.

Fast and smooth CPS drop and rise is made to make it harder for games to suspect that you are using Boost CPS. There will also be a slight difference in the time duration between clicks when using Boost CPS. Made also for the same reason.

I would like to point out that the start and end sounds are different. And also that if there was no sound signal, it means that you need to press the key again.

# Source code
If you are interested in the source code of the project, it can be found in the *BoostCPS source code* folder. To open the project, you need to open the *BoostCPS.sln* file in Visual Studio and then you can use the project.
